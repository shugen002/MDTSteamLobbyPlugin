## MDTSteamLobbyPlugin

Mindustry Steam Lobby Plugin

### What is this SHIT

You can host a server showing the steam local server list.

All the traffic will go through steam p2p network , so you don't need to have a public ip, but you need a extra steam account for server use.

### Setup

1. Install steam client and login.
2. Create a file name `steam_appid.txt` with content `1127400` next to `server-release.jar`.
3. Place the `MDTSteamLobbyPlugin.jar` in your server's `config/mods` directory and restart the server.

### Known Problem

We only tested on Windows . If you success in other system , please info me.
